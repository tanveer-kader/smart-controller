Electrical Drives and Instruments 
## Abstract  
An IoT based system that controls the accessories of home. One can control the system from anywhere through the internet. It’s a prototype of a ***Smart Control System***. Where all the electrical and electronic accessories of a house can be controlled over internet. Such as, light, fan, television, air-condition, doors etc. All these accessories are connected to the main program board (Arduino). This board holds the program to control these accessories. The board is connected to internet over a Wi-Fi module.

## Introduction  
## Motivation  
Building something physical is really a pleasure. When we see the existence of our work it pushes us to do more. It makes us more confident. This project is something like that. The Smart Control System has no boundaries as it can be controlled from anywhere over the internet connection. It is a very interesting thing. It increased our curiosity. So, we went for it.  
## Existing Works  
**Bluetooth Controlled Systems:** The system is controlled by Bluetooth module which is connected to the remote. The remote can control all the accessories 
in its range.
## Problem Statement
The existing Bluetooth Controlled System has few problems in it. One of the most important is it only works in the Bluetooth range. So, distance of the accesories and remote is a serious issue here. If the distance between them is goes out of the boundaries it doesn’t work.  
## Objective of the Work  
- To develop a system that can be controlled over the internet.  
- To analyze the performance of the system.  
## Methodology
## Apparatus
- Arduino WeMos D1 R1  
- Relay module  
- Blynk android app  
- Motors  
- Lights etc.  
## Contribution to the Industry and Society
It’s importance only can be understand when we try it and start getting the benefits from it. A lot of benefit it offers. Some are listed below:  
- It reduces the work pressure.
- It is easy to control.
- It gives comfort.
- Can be controlled from anywhere.
- More secure and safe.
- Keep track what’s going on your machines.  
More benefits will come when we will start implementing on our world machines.
