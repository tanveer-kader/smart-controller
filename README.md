Electrical Drives and Instruments 
An IoT based system that controls the accessories of home. One can control the system from anywhere through the internet. 
## Abstract  
It’s a prototype of a ***Smart Home System***. Where all the electrical and electronic accessories of a house can be controlled over internet. Such as, light, fan, television, air-condition, doors etc. All these accessories are connected to the main program board (Arduino). This board holds the program to control these accessories. The board is connected to internet over a Wi-Fi module.

## Introduction  
## Motivation  
Building something physical is really a pleasure. When we see the existence of our work it pushes us to do more. It makes us more confident. This project is something like that. The Smart Home System has no boundaries as it can be controlled from anywhere over the internet connection. It is a very interesting thing. It increased our curiosity. So, we went for it.  
## Existing Works  
**Bluetooth Home Automation:** In this system the system is controlled by Bluetooth module which is connected to the remote. The remote can control all the accessories 
in its range.
## Problem Statement
The existing Bluetooth Home Automation has few problems with it. One of the most important is it only works in the Bluetooth range. So, distance of the system and remote is a serious issue here. If the distance between them is goes out of the boundaries it doesn’t work.  
## Objective of the Work  
- To develop a system that can be controlled over the internet.  
- To analyze the performance of the system.  
## Tools
Arduino WeMos D1 R1, Relay module, Blynk android app, Motors, Lights etc.
